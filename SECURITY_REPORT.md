# 🔬 State of Solana DeFi Security — February 2026

*Automated analysis of upgrade authority patterns across top Solana DeFi protocols.*

**Tool**: [solscan-cli](https://github.com/contactn8n410-del/solscan-cli) `--power-map`
**Date**: February 14, 2026
**Methodology**: On-chain data extraction via Solana JSON-RPC. Zero off-chain data. All findings are from public blockchain state.

---

## Executive Summary

- **15 top DeFi protocols** analyzed
- **13/15 (87%)** are upgradeable — code can be changed by a single authority key
- **Only 2** are fully immutable (Orca Token Swap, Mango Markets v3)
- **1 authority key** controls 2 major protocols (Raydium CPMM + AMM v4)
- **8 authority wallets** show zero recent transaction activity (dormant keys)

---

## Key Findings

### 🔴 Finding 1: Raydium Authority Concentration

**Raydium CPMM** and **Raydium AMM v4** — two of the highest-TVL protocols on Solana — share the **same upgrade authority**: `GThUX1At...hFMJ`.

- This wallet holds **377.09 SOL** and has **100+ recent transactions**
- A compromise of this single key would affect both protocols simultaneously
- **Recommendation**: Separate authorities for each protocol, or migrate to multisig with timelock

### 🟡 Finding 2: Dormant Authority Keys

8 out of 13 upgradeable protocols have authority wallets with **zero recent transactions**:

| Protocol | Authority | Balance | Recent TXs |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Solend | `2Fwvr3MK...Kxjk` | 12.01 SOL | 0 |
| Drift Protocol | `CjoV5B96...N1Mj` | 1.99 SOL | 0 |
| Saber | `BkkBFsRm...4Tkr` | 0.00 SOL | 0 |
| Phoenix DEX | `8mv7G3fJ...itEq` | 0.00 SOL | 0 |
| Serum DEX v3 | `8xYs2tGX...Vbys` | 0.01 SOL | 0 |
| Meteora DLMM | `JADaUV8k...CVLd` | 0.23 SOL | 0 |
| FluxBeam | `AGmRsqwk...vSTq` | 0.00 SOL | 0 |
| Marinade Finance | `551FBXSX...yzBp` | 0.00 SOL | 0 |

**Interpretation**: Dormant keys may be in cold storage (good security) or may indicate lost/inaccessible keys (risk of inability to patch vulnerabilities).

**Recommendation**: Protocols should publicly document their key management practices.

### 🟢 Finding 3: Immutable Programs (Best Practice)

Only **2 protocols** have renounced upgrade authority:

- **Orca Token Swap** — fully immutable
- **Mango Markets v3** — fully immutable

These cannot be modified by anyone, eliminating rug-pull risk from authority compromise.

### 🟡 Finding 4: Active Authorities

3 protocols have authorities with high transaction counts (100+):

| Protocol | Authority | Balance | Activity |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Jupiter v6 | `CvQZZ23q...tipQ` | 0.33 SOL | Very active |
| Orca Whirlpool | `GwH3Hiv5...x4PV` | 4.18 SOL | Very active |
| Marginfi v2 | `J3oBkTkD...FD47` | 7.23 SOL | Very active |

**Interpretation**: Frequent upgrades suggest active development but also larger attack surface.

## Methodology

All data was extracted using `solscan-cli --power-map`, which:

1. Queries each program's account via `getAccountInfo`
2. Identifies BPF Upgradeable Loader programs
3. Decodes the programdata account address from program account data
4. Extracts the upgrade authority from the programdata account
5. Profiles each authority wallet (balance, transaction count)

**No private data was accessed.** All information is publicly available on-chain.

---

## Reproduce

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/contactn8n410-del/solscan-cli
solscan x --power-map
solscan x --power-map --json | jq
```

## Disclosure

This report is published as open research. No vulnerabilities were exploited. All findings relate to publicly observable on-chain state.

Protocols mentioned are encouraged to:
1. Document their key management practices publicly
2. Consider timelocks on upgrades
3. Migrate to multisig authorities where applicable
4. Consider renouncing authority for stable, audited code
